# Social-Network-API

## Description
Build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM


**Note**: I followed the criteria below provided by the class instructors.
